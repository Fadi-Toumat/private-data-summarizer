# Private Data Summarizer with Generative AI  

This repository contains a **Flask-based AI project** built as part of the **IBM AI Developer course**. The application demonstrates how to use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques combined with **Watsonx Large Language Models (LLaMA 3-3 70B)** and **LangChain** to:  

- Process and analyze **private documents (PDFs)**  
- **Summarize** content into clear, concise insights  
- Provide **context-aware answers** to user questions via a chat interface  

The project is designed as a **learning resource** for developers and students exploring how to build practical AI solutions that combine **document retrieval**, **vector databases**, and **generative AI**.

## Educational Context  

This project was originally developed as part of the **IBM AI Developer professional certification**.  
It is shared here for **educational and non-commercial purposes**, so others can:  

- Study how RAG pipelines are built with **LangChain, Watsonx LLM, and Chroma**  
- Learn how to integrate **Flask** to serve AI-driven applications  
- Experiment with AI-assisted document summarization

## Structure  

- **`/project`** – Contains the full application code, including:  
  - `server.py` (Flask backend)  
  - `worker.py` (AI pipeline with LangChain, Watsonx, Hugging Face embeddings, and Chroma)  
  - Supporting files: templates, dependencies, and license  

- **External README (this file)** – Provides context about the project’s purpose and origin
